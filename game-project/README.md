# About Me

Hi, you. I'm a **Game Programmer** that focuses on developing a 2D game with Unity. I love exploring a lot of new things about optimizing in a game engine and programming itself. I have a dream to makes a game engine by myself or maybe if I have a team for it, I love to make a plugin/library about game development in Unity, I made it simplify in the development of other games for myself or maybe other which needs something that I made. This is my portfolio about my journey in Game Development, I hope you enjoy it.
