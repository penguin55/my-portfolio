Gadget Factory is a casual game that develops for Global Game Jam 2018 on Surabaya.
With simple mechanics to package still good computer components and destroy defective 
products during production. With the theme  "Transmission " and inspired by the rail system 
that changed line 1 to other lines, our team got the idea to create a Gadget Factory with the same mechanism.
