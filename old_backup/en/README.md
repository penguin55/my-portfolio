# About Me

Hi, you. I'm a **Game Programmer** that focuses on developing a game with Unity. I love exploring a lot of new things about optimizing in a game engine and programming itself. I have a dream to makes a game engine by myself or maybe if I have a team for it, I love to make a plugin/library about game development in Unity, I made it to simplify the development of other games for myself or maybe others who need something that I made. This is my portfolio about my journey in Game Development, I hope you enjoy it.

## My Journey in Game Development
#### Where I Start my Journey
I start my journey on the late 2017 by take the academy from Raion Community about Game Programming in 2D Game Development.
From the Raion's academy I've been learn about how to code UI in Game and simple mechanic to generate random position
of an object.

#### My First Global Game Jam
I'm an optimistic person about my skill in programming, on the early years 2018 and a month since I learned about game programming, I've attended Global Game Jam 2018 on Surabaya.
I believe that if I have a courage to step forward, I would be better than before. Because of that, I take my step to attended my first
Global Game Jam although I just learns about Game programming one month ago at that time.

#### Tools that I use
I have been using Unity Engine since my first academy at Raion Community in December 2018. Unity Engine is a friendly engine that is easy to learn and use, because of its big community. I also tried to make a voxel 3D model just for hobbies using 3D magica Voxel since January 2022, I love voxel art and am always amazed by some games that use voxel for their game asset.

I also tried some other game engines, such as the Phaser engine and JavaScript from scratch. I just tried it in the last 2 months to create a simulation game genre.

## My Game Jam History

#### Global Game Jam 2018 Surabaya

In this Game Jam, I trying to be an UI Programmer to make a 2D Game with the main theme "Transmission".
This game jam is make me know more about how to be a real game programmer, because in my team there are
experienced game programmer. So, I can learns more from him about how to code game's mechanic.

#### Global Game Jam 2019 Jogja

With the main theme "What home means to you", my team has an briliant ideas to make a horror puzzle game
with voice detection to help players when the time will run out. In this year I still became UI Programmer but
I also handle some code other than UI code, such as voice detection and environment programming to help my other mechanic programmer in my team. 

#### SIMMERJam

SIMMERJam is an Online Game Jam that organized by [Simmer.io](https://simmer.io/) on May 2019. The main theme on this game jam is "Minimalism" with an emphasis on using just 2 colors or shades.
I'm working on this game jam with only programmer in one team, because I want to know how far I can collaborate with other programmer
to make a simple game. For the result of this game jam, I starts to learn how to be a good programmer to code a program that easily other programmer to
read and understand with what I do. 


#### Hackjam

Hackjam is a Hackathon and Game Jam events that held at the same time by Raion Community for its member who focus
on apps or game development. With an awesome team, I can make a game with unique mechanic and got a favorite team nomination.
From this I can learn how to think and works in team that can make an awesome game mechanics. 

#### Global Game Jam 2020 Surabaya

This is a memorable Global Game Jam event for me, because I try something that I think is impossible for me but I can do it. 
At the time of this event I developed a 3D game for the first time since I focused on game development. 
My team making games like space engineer with a simple mechanic for this year's theme "Repair". From this GGJ I can learn something important 
to never give up even though it looks impossible to do with myself.

#### Global Game Jam 2022 Malang

## Game Projects

I made a lot of game, this is my game projects from game jam, competition, course, commission and just for self-development.

#### Spacecraft Impact

Spacecraft Impact is my first 3D game, developed at Global Game Jam 2020 on Surabaya. With the theme "Repair" for this year and inspired
from Space Engineer and Dead By Dead By Daylight game, my team has an idea to develops this game. The player must
protect the spacecraft and repair it when the part is broken.

## My Libraries

I'm trying to make a lot of game libraries to facilitate the development of games in Unity Engine both for me and others who need it.
Hopefully this helps you

#### Audio Loops

Audio Loops is a plugin for Unity Engine which I develops to help you with playing an audio game with loops at specific time you want. 
Unity Engine can actually perform audio looping with Audio Source Component, but if you wants loop at specific time or maybe wants to play an audio
at specific time you have to code a bit more complex, by defining where you want to repeat or manually by setting up the clipped audio.
In this libraries there's a function for that, so you don't have to think about it anymore. You only need to use the function in accordance with the documentation listed.
