# About Me

Hi, you. I'm a **Game Programmer** which focus in developing 2D game with Unity. I love exploring a lot of new things about optimizing in game engine and programming itself. 
I have a dream to makes a game engines by myself or maybe if i have a team for it, I love to makes a plugin/library about game development in Unity, I made it to simplify in the development of other games for myself or maybe other which needs something that i made.
This is my portfolio about my journey in Game Development, I Hope you enjoy it.

## My Journey in Game Development
#### Where I Start my Journey
I start my journey on the late 2017 by take the academy from Raion Community about Game Programming in 2D Game Development.
From the Raion's academy I've been learn about how to code UI in Game and simple mechanic to generate random position
of an object.

#### My First Global Game Jam
I'm an optimistic person about my skill in programming, on the early years 2018 and a month since I learned about game programming, I've attended Global Game Jam 2018 on Surabaya.
I believe that if I have a courage to step forward, I would be better than before. Because of that, I take my step to attended my first
Global Game Jam although I just learns about Game programming one month ago at that time.

#### Tools that I use
I've been use Unity Engine 2 years from my first academy at Raion Community. Unity Engine is friendly to use, easy to learn because have a big community.
I also tried some other game engines, such as the Phaser engine and JavaScript from scratch. I just tried it in the last 2 months to create a simulation game genre.
