## My Journey in Game Development
### Where I start my Journey
I start my journey on the late 2017 by take the academy from Raion Community about Game Programming in 2D Game Development.
From the Raion's academy I've been learn about how to code UI in Game and simple mechanic to generate random position
of an object.

### My First Global Game Jam
I'm an optimistic person about my skill in programming, on the early years 2018 and a month since I learned about game programming, I've attended Global Game Jam 2018 on Surabaya.
I believe that if I have a courage to step forward, I would be better than before. Because of that, I take my step to attended my first
Global Game Jam although I just learns about Game programming one month ago at that time.

### Tools that I use
I've been use Unity Engine 2 years from my first academy at Raion Community. Unity Engine is friendly to use, easy to learn because have a big community.
