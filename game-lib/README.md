# Audio Loops

![AL](/images/lib/audio-loops.gif)

Audio Loops is a plugin for Unity Engine which I develops to help you with playing an audio game with loops at specific time you want. 
Unity Engine can actually perform audio looping with Audio Source Component, but if you wants loop at specific time or maybe wants to 
play an audio at specific time you have to code a bit more complex, by defining where you want to repeat or manually by setting up the clipped audio. 
In this libraries there’s a function for that, so you don’t have to think about it anymore. You only need to use the function in accordance with the documentation listed.
